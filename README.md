# Blender Farm

*A fully fledged remote blender farm written in NodeJS*

This personnal project of mine is a server designed to be deployed on my home serveur.
It runs multiple GPUs for 3D Rendering with Blender, and I need a way to automate rendering jobs from my workstation.

I will try my best to make it configurable so that anyone could technically deploy it on their own server.
Please [email me](https://github.com/ScottishCyclops) if you have questions. For suggestions, use the [Github issues](https://github.com/ScottishCyclops/blender_farm/issues).
